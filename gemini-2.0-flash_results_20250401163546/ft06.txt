Conversation history: 
user: You are given 6 jobs and 6 machines. Each job consists of 6 operations that must be processed in a predefined sequence on designated machines with given processing times:
Job 0 follows the machine sequence 2 → 0 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 4 with processing times 1, 3, 6, 7, 3, 6.
Job 1 follows the machine sequence 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 0 → 3 with processing times 8, 5, 10, 10, 10, 4.
Job 2 follows the machine sequence 2 → 3 → 5 → 0 → 1 → 4 with processing times 5, 4, 8, 9, 1, 7.
Job 3 follows the machine sequence 1 → 0 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 with processing times 5, 5, 5, 3, 8, 9.
Job 4 follows the machine sequence 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 0 → 3 with processing times 9, 3, 5, 4, 3, 1.
Job 5 follows the machine sequence 1 → 3 → 5 → 0 → 4 → 2 with processing times 3, 3, 9, 10, 4, 1.
Below are some previous operation-based representations of schedules and their makespan values. The representations are arranged in descending order of makespan, where smaller values indicate better performance.

Try to find a new representation such that its makespan is smaller than all of the above. The representation must satisfy the following conditions:
1. It must be different from all representations above. 
2. It must start with <rep> and end with </rep>. 
3. It must contain 36 numbers in total, with each job number appearing exactly 6 times.
Do not write code.
system: Here's a new representation that aims for a smaller makespan based on the provided information and a bit of educated guessing:

<rep> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 60, which is equal to the previous minimum of 60.
system: You are correct. My apologies. Let's try to find a representation that focuses on better machine utilization and less contention on critical machines, particularly machines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 which seem to be used more frequently across jobs.  Let's also try to stagger similar jobs slightly.

<rep> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 4, 1, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2, 5, 5, 4, 1, 0, 2, 3 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 65, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. I need to find a representation that's different from the existing ones and has a makespan *less* than 60. The previous attempts resulted in makespans that were either equal to or greater than the best found so far.  Let's focus on minimizing contention on the critical machines (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and introduce more staggering while still respecting the job operation order.  I'll try to delay certain jobs that heavily utilize those machines, especially early on.

<rep> 0, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 5, 5, 4, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2, 5, 4, 0, 3, 1, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2, 5 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 67, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. I need to find a *different* representation with a makespan *strictly less* than 60. I need to prioritize resource utilization and reduce contention on Machines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during the early stages. This involves careful staggering of the jobs and potentially prioritizing jobs that don't heavily rely on those bottleneck machines at the beginning.

<rep> 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 5, 3, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 0, 4, 1, 0, 5, 1 </rep>

user: Job number 2 appears 5 times in the representation.
system: Okay, let's try to create a new representation that prioritizes a lower makespan by addressing the initial bottlenecks on Machines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We'll try to stagger the jobs so they don't all demand those resources at the same time.  Also, let's focus on completing Jobs 0, 2, 4 and 5 a bit earlier if possible, as they seem to be contributing to the makespan.  This will involve experimenting with the order of operations while adhering to the given machine sequences for each job.

<rep> 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 5, 3, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 0, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 72, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, let's try another representation, again focusing on staggering the initial operations on machines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We will also prioritize jobs 0, 2, 4, and 5 slightly earlier. We'll also make sure each job appears 6 times.

<rep> 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 5, 3, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 2 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 72, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. I need to find a representation that's different from the ones provided, has 36 numbers (0-5, each appearing 6 times), and results in a makespan *smaller* than 60.

Let's try prioritizing jobs with potentially shorter operations earlier in the schedule and focusing on staggering operations across machines to minimize bottlenecks. Let's prioritize jobs 1 and 4 a little more this time, as they have some short initial operations.

<rep> 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 64, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I need to revise my approach. Staggering and prioritizing are good ideas, but the specific instantiation needs improvement. Let's try to front-load Jobs 1, 4, and 0 a bit more aggressively, while ensuring valid operation order. Let's also aim for a smoother distribution to avoid long machine idle times.

<rep> 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1, 0, 4, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 64, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. Let's aim for an even more aggressive early loading of jobs 1, 4, and 0, and try to distribute the remaining jobs to fill gaps and reduce machine idle time. I'll also try to avoid long contiguous sequences of the same job.

<rep> 1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1, 0, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 74, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand the feedback. I need to find a representation with a makespan *strictly less* than 60. The current approach of aggressively loading jobs 1, 4, and 0 isn't consistently yielding the best results. I need to think about a different strategy that focuses on minimizing idle time across all machines. A more balanced distribution *might* be better. Let's try to stagger the jobs more evenly from the start, while still prioritizing earlier completion of some jobs.

<rep> 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 60, which is equal to the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I need to change my strategy again. The previous attempts failed to break the 60 makespan barrier. I need to think more carefully about how different job orderings interact with the machine sequences and processing times. Instead of focusing on one or two jobs early, perhaps a more interleaved approach will help. The jobs with longer operations (especially on machines that are frequent bottlenecks) need to be carefully scheduled.

Let's try to prioritize jobs with shorter operations on bottleneck machines early on, to keep them moving. Then, introduce the longer jobs in a staggered way. Also, I will try to avoid placing consecutive operations of the same job close together.

<rep> 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 0, 3, 4 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 61, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. I need to find a representation that has a makespan *strictly less* than 60, is different from all the listed representations, and adheres to the specified format (36 numbers, each job appearing 6 times). The challenge lies in the complex interaction of job ordering, machine sequences, and processing times. I need to be more strategic than just trying to interleave jobs. I need to somehow identify critical path operations and try to minimize their delays.

Let's try a representation that attempts to prioritize certain jobs early on bottleneck machines, and avoids long consecutive operations of the same job. I will make sure that the final representation is different from all the listed examples.

<rep> 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 0, 3, 4 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 61, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. All my attempts resulted in makespans greater than or equal to 60, or were invalid. It's surprisingly difficult to improve upon the existing schedules. I will try a more targeted approach. I will focus on overlapping operations from jobs that use the same machines.

<rep> 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 0, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 0, 4, 3 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 61, which is larger than the previous minimum of 60.
system: Okay, I understand. It seems very difficult to find a schedule with a makespan less than 60 using this approach. My attempts to create better schedules have consistently failed. I will try a different approach and generate a random valid solution and hope the makespan is better.

<rep> 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 5, 2, 0, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 0, 4, 0, 5, 3, 1, 2 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 60, which is equal to the previous minimum of 60.
system: I have tried several times to generate a valid representation of the schedule that results in a makespan smaller than 60, but I have consistently failed. My generated schedules have either been invalid, or have resulted in a makespan of 60 or greater. I apologize, but I am unable to fulfill the request at this time.

user: Please try again.
system: Okay, I will try to create a new representation that results in a makespan smaller than 60, while adhering to all the specified conditions.

<rep> 4, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 5, 3, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 0, 4, 1, 0, 5, 2 </rep>
