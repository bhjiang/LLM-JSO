user: You are given 10 jobs and 5 machines. Each job consists of 5 operations that must be processed in a predefined sequence on designated machines with given processing times:
Job 0 follows the machine sequence 0 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 with processing times 12, 94, 92, 91, 7.
Job 1 follows the machine sequence 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 0 with processing times 19, 11, 66, 21, 87.
Job 2 follows the machine sequence 1 → 0 → 3 → 4 → 2 with processing times 14, 75, 13, 16, 20.
Job 3 follows the machine sequence 2 → 4 → 0 → 3 → 1 with processing times 95, 66, 7, 7, 77.
Job 4 follows the machine sequence 1 → 3 → 4 → 0 → 2 with processing times 45, 6, 89, 15, 34.
Job 5 follows the machine sequence 3 → 2 → 0 → 4 → 1 with processing times 77, 20, 76, 88, 53.
Job 6 follows the machine sequence 2 → 1 → 0 → 3 → 4 with processing times 74, 88, 52, 27, 9.
Job 7 follows the machine sequence 1 → 3 → 0 → 4 → 2 with processing times 88, 69, 62, 98, 52.
Job 8 follows the machine sequence 2 → 4 → 0 → 1 → 3 with processing times 61, 9, 62, 52, 90.
Job 9 follows the machine sequence 2 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 0 with processing times 54, 5, 59, 15, 88.

Try to find a new representation such that its makespan is smaller than all of the above. The representation must satisfy the following conditions:
1. It must be different from all representations above. 
2. It must start with <rep> and end with </rep>. 
3. It must contain 50 numbers in total, with each job number appearing exactly 5 times.
Do not write code.
system: Okay, I will attempt to generate a new operation-based representation that potentially yields a lower makespan than the provided examples, while adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's my attempt:

user: Great! The makespan of this representation is 666, which is smaller than the previous minimum of 775. Give me a new representation again.

system: Okay, I understand. I need to find a new representation with 50 numbers, each job appearing 5 times, that is different from all previous representations, and has a makespan smaller than 666. This is a difficult optimization problem, but here's my next attempt:

<rep> 3, 9, 0, 6, 1, 8, 4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 7, 2, 5, 4, 1, 0, 3, 8, 9, 3, 6, 8, 4, 2, 0, 5, 1, 7, 9, 1, 5, 3, 4, 0, 8, 2, 7, 6, 9, 5, 4, 8, 0, 7, 2, 1, 9, 6, 3 </rep>

user: The makespan of this representation is 691, which is larger than the previous minimum of 666.
system: Okay, I understand. I'm still aiming for a representation with a makespan smaller than 666, while avoiding previous representations and ensuring each job appears exactly 5 times.
